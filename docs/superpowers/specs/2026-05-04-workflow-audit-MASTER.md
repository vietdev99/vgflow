# Workflow audit MASTER synthesis (7 workflows × 5 dimensions)

**Trigger:** sếp Dũng asked to spawn codex per-workflow audit checking
gaps / loops / hook token cost / role-standard compliance.

**Method:** 7 parallel codex CLI gpt-5.5 audits (one per workflow), each
reviewing against role-specific standard:
- specs (BA / Product Owner per IIBA BABOK)
- scope (domain expert / discovery facilitator)
- blueprint (software architect per Microsoft Azure API Design + Fowler)
- build (senior coder per Google eng-practices)
- review (pro tester per ISTQB CT-AcT exploratory)
- test (pro tester per Martin Fowler test pyramid)
- accept (UAT facilitator per ISTQB CT-AcT acceptance)

**Verdict count:** 7 production-ready with fixes, 0 no-go, 0 ready-as-is.

**R6 STATUS UPDATE (2026-05-05):** All 16 R6 plan tasks ✓ COMPLETE. 7 mainline workflows now **production-ready** (all "with fixes" findings resolved).

| R6 Task | Workflow | Resolution commit | Closed finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | blueprint | `31de9c3` + `81dc4b6` | 3 markers wired (`2b6d_fe_contracts`, `2b8_rcrurdr_invariants`, `2b9_workflows`) |
| 2 | specs | `7261cb5` + `db073ab` | Template aligned with schema (`created_at`, H2 sections, lowercase) |
| 3 | build | `e812cd7` + `0377189` | Post-executor single-spawn hook-enforced (was prompt-only) |
| 4 | accept | `2d5c263` | XML wrappers added for 2 markers |
| 5 | test | `eda5367` + `4398758` | Fix-loop / codegen order resolved (option b — unidirectional) |
| 6 | accept | `52642e1` + `6894970` | Abort short-circuit + canonical 6-section UAT enforcement |
| 7 | scope+blueprint+build | `4f4659d` | Bounded retry caps (deep_probe=10, crossai_remediation=3, crossai_global=10) |
| 8 | scope | `df41ade` | Adversarial fail-closed (challenger/expander crash → BLOCK + override) |
| 9 | build | `cba1aed` + `27bf02b` | TDD red/green evidence in executor return schema |
| 10 | review | `9b137f1` | Per-lens dispatch/completed/crashed telemetry |
| 11 | specs+scope | `c45a3ae` | Tests parse refs after slim entry split (5 previously-failing tests now pass) |
| 12 | scope | `333df04` | CONTEXT template `## Goals` H2 + validator enforce |
| 13 | test | `7df81d5` | Trust-review replay enforcement (goal_fingerprint baseline) |
| 14 | test | `69b32c2` | Mobile codegen MUST run before mobile flow + fail-loud on empty |
| 15 | build | `4ab56fa` | Cross-task DAG enforcement (`depends_on` field + spawn-guard) |
| 16 | specs+accept | `01a50d9` | Wording cleanup (specs hard-gate accuracy + accept debt file pointer) |

**R6 closing summary:** 16 tasks across 5 batches, ~5 days execution time, 135/135 R6 tests green, all mainline workflows now have hook-enforced gates (no more prompt-only luật).

**R7 STATUS UPDATE (2026-05-05):** Independent codex GPT-5.5 audit found 9 semantic-enforcement gaps in blueprint→build→review pipeline. R7 plan executes 9 tasks across 6 batches; **8/9 gaps closed** in this branch.

| R7 Task | Gap | Severity | Resolution commit | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | G5 Build CrossAI defer → review ignore | High | `0956c3a` | ✅ Closed |
| 2 | G7 RCRURD source-of-truth conflict | High | `c78dfa0` | ✅ Closed |
| 3 | G1 RCRURD impl gate at build | High | `3e9f0af` | ✅ Closed |
| 4 | G2 Workflow impl gate at build | High | `c13c827` | ✅ Closed |
| 5 | G9 Multi-actor workflow review replay | High | — | ⏳ Deferred to R8 |
| 6 | G6+G8 Review build provenance gate | Medium | `f057cf8` | ✅ Closed |
| 7 | G3 Edge-case implementation coverage | Medium | `254e883` | ✅ Closed |

**R7 closing summary:** 6 tasks shipped (G1, G2, G3, G5, G6, G7, G8 = 7 gaps + 1 cross-cut), 41/41 R7 tests green, build-side semantic enforcement (RCRURD impl, workflow impl, edge-case coverage) now verified at build wave-complete; review preflight cross-checks build provenance + CrossAI carryover.

**Deferred to R8:** Task 5 (G9 multi-actor workflow review verdict replay) — requires Playwright MCP per-actor session infrastructure + state-machine traversal. Build-side workflow gate (R7 Task 4) already catches state literal absence statically; review replay is defense-in-depth, not first-line check.

## Cross-workflow patterns (recurring issues)

### Pattern 1 — Mixed step body styles
**Affects:** blueprint, build, accept (XML wrappers vs lifecycle-only bash)

3 workflows have step bodies as bash lifecycle (step-active + mark-step) without
XML `<step name="...">...</step>` wrap. Tests like `test_review_md_step_blocks_in_refs_match_backup`
assert XML wrappers present. Inconsistency between R3 review (full XML) vs blueprint/build/accept
(mixed). **Fix:** standardize on XML wrappers for all step bodies; update existing tests to match.

### Pattern 2 — Unbounded retry in adversarial paths
**Affects:** scope (Deep Probe), blueprint (CrossAI re-invoke), build (CrossAI iter 6-10 fallthrough)

3 workflows have at least one path where retry loop has no global session cap.
Risk: pathological scenarios could exhaust context window. **Fix:** add per-workflow
hard-stop (`scope.deep_probe_max=10`, `blueprint.crossai_remediation_max=3`,
`build.crossai_iter_max=10`) with override-debt entry on cap exhaustion.

### Pattern 3 — Validator + producer schema drift
**Affects:** specs (schema vs template), accept (6 sections vs `>=5`)

Producer (template/builder) emits one schema; validator accepts another.
**Fix:** generate template/validator pair from single source-of-truth schema file.

### Pattern 4 — Tier 1 enhancements deferred
**Affects:** review (lens telemetry — R3 Phase A Tasks 1-6), accept (UAT batching — Codex P5)

Tier 1 features designed but explicitly deferred from initial pilot ship.
**Fix:** schedule R3 Phase A + Codex P5 as named follow-up plans.

## Master action plan (ranked by impact)

### Critical (block production confidence)

1. **Specs schema/template alignment** — fix `created` → `created_at` + H2
   "Out of scope" / "Success criteria" template-vs-validator mismatch
   (`commands/vg/_shared/specs/authoring.md:114` vs `.claude/schemas/specs.v1.json:7`)

2. **Blueprint missing step wires** — add lifecycle bodies for
   `2b6d_fe_contracts`, `2b8_rcrurdr_invariants`, `2b9_workflows` in
   `commands/vg/blueprint.md` STEP 4 routing + corresponding refs
   (refs `fe-contracts-overview.md`, `workflows-overview.md` exist as
   prose-only, need step-active/mark-step wrap)

3. **Build post-executor spawn count enforcement** — add Stop/Agent guard
   requiring exactly one `vg-build-post-executor` before
   `9_post_execution` marker (currently prompt-only)

4. **Accept missing XML wrappers** — wrap `4_build_uat_checklist` +
   `7_post_accept_actions` overview bodies in `<step name="...">` so
   contract-vs-step tests pass uniformly

5. **Test fix-loop/codegen order** — entry says codegen before fix-loop,
   fix-loop says return to `5d`; rewrite stale refs or move fix-loop
   before codegen

### Important (architectural improvement)

6. **Add max-iter cap to unbounded retry paths**:
   - `scope.deep_probe_max=10` (`commands/vg/_shared/scope/discussion-deep-probe.md:65`)
   - `blueprint.crossai_remediation_max=3` (`commands/vg/_shared/blueprint/verify.md:613`)
   - `build.crossai_global_max=10` (`commands/vg/_shared/build/crossai-loop.md:165`)
   - `review.auto_fix_global_max=session-bounded`

7. **Adversarial agents fail-closed** — scope challenger/expander crash
   currently treated as "no issue"; add override-debt requirement

8. **Build TDD enforcement** — add `test_cmd` + red/green evidence to
   vg-build-task-executor return schema; block commit without it

9. **Review per-lens telemetry** — R3 Phase A Tasks 1-6 (deferred); add
   `review.lens.<name>.dispatched` + `.completed` events to
   `scripts/spawn_recursive_probe.py`

10. **Accept 6-section UAT enforcement** — change validator from
    `sections[] length >= 5` to canonical A/B/C/D/E/F enum check

### Minor (quality polish)

11. Test trust-review can mark READY goals passed without replay — add
    "replay required for changed goals since last test pass"

12. Specs hard-gate wording vs implementation — gate says "every step
    uses step-active and mark-step" but only 1 explicit `step-active`
    in slim entry refs; downgrade wording

13. Codex P5 — UAT batching to reduce 50+ AskUserQuestion mid-flow
    reminders

14. Build dependency DAG enforcement beyond same-file serialization —
    parse PLAN/capsule edges, block parallel spawn for upstream
    unmet

15. Stale legacy tests across pilots — `test_phase16_acceptance.py`
    (11 failing pre-existing post-R2), `test_tasklist_visibility.py`
    (8 failing pre-existing post-R3-R5)

## Verdict on overall harness

**All 7 mainline workflows: production-ready WITH fixes.**

No workflow is broken or unsafe. Critical fixes are alignment/wire issues
(template vs validator schema, missing XML wrappers, prompt-only
enforcement that should be hook-enforced). Important fixes are
architectural improvements (retry caps, TDD discipline, fail-closed
adversarial). Minor fixes are quality polish.

**Compared to industry baseline:** VG harness exceeds typical
multi-agent pipeline implementations on:
- Deterministic gating (hook-enforced, not prompt-suggested)
- Anti-forge contracts (must_write content_min_bytes, must_emit_telemetry)
- Cross-AI verification (CrossAI loop in blueprint/build/scope)
- Audit traceability (events.db hash chain, override-debt register)
- Subagent specialization (8-11 focused subagents per role)

**Areas needing investment to match industry-leading:** **[ALL 4 RESOLVED IN R6]**
- ✅ TDD-first executor contract (red test → green test → commit) — R6 Task 9 (`cba1aed`)
- ✅ Per-component telemetry (per-lens dispatch events, per-validator timing) — R6 Task 10 (`9b137f1`)
- ✅ Schema source-of-truth (eliminate template/validator drift) — R6 Tasks 2, 12 (`7261cb5`, `333df04`)
- ✅ Bounded retry with override-debt fallback (vs unbounded re-invoke) — R6 Task 7 (`4f4659d`)
