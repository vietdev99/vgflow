All notable changes to VG workflow documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), adheres to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (UX — stuck UI tail across runs)
- **Stuck TodoWrite items hanging in Claude Code's "Baking…" / "Hullaballooing…" status box across `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:build` runs** — items like "Phase 2b-1: Navigator", "Start pnpm dev + wait health" persisted from interrupted previous runs because TodoWrite list wasn't reset/cleared.
- **Root cause:** v1.3.0 session lifecycle banner only displaces `echo` narration tail, not TodoWrite items (which are model-only, bash trap can't touch them).
- **Fix:** Added `<TODOWRITE_POLICY>` directive block at top of `commands/vg/review.md`, `test.md`, `build.md`. Tells executing model:
  1. FIRST tool call MUST be a TodoWrite that REPLACES stale items (overwrites entire list)
  2. Mark each item `completed` immediately when done — don't batch
  3. Exit path (success OR error) MUST leave NO `pending`/`in_progress` items
  4. Better default: prefer `narrate_phase` (echo) over TodoWrite for granular per-step progress
- Companion update in `_shared/session-lifecycle.md` documents the symptom + recommended pattern (≤7 top-level milestones max for TodoWrite, echo for everything else).

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (CRITICAL — extend preservation gate to all migrate steps)
- **`/vg:migrate` steps 5, 6, 7 also had overwrite-without-diff risk** (v1.3.1 only fixed step 4 CONTEXT.md):
  - Step 5 **API-CONTRACTS.md**: `--force` case overwrote existing without preserving endpoint paths
  - Step 6 **TEST-GOALS.md**: `--force` case overwrote existing without preserving G-XX goals + bodies
  - Step 7 **PLAN.md attribution**: Agent trusted to "only add attributes" but no verification — task descriptions could be silently rewritten/dropped
- **Fix:** All 4 mutation steps (4/5/6/7) now write to `{file}.staged` first. Preservation gates before promote:
  - IDs preserved (D-XX, G-XX, Task N, endpoint paths — depending on artifact type)
  - Body similarity ≥ 80% (difflib.SequenceMatcher) — attribute-stripped for PLAN.md
  - On fail: original untouched, staging kept at `{file}.staged`, backup in `.gsd-backup/`
- **Universal rule added to `<rules>` block**: "MERGE, DO NOT OVERWRITE" — codifies staging+diff+gate pattern for any future migrate step or similar mutation command.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (CRITICAL — data safety)
- **`/vg:migrate` step 4 `_enrich_context` was losing decisions silently** — agent wrote directly to `CONTEXT.md`, overwriting original. If agent dropped or merged D-XX decisions, they were **permanently lost** (backup in `.gsd-backup/` but no automatic diff/rollback).
- **Fix:** Agent now writes to `CONTEXT.md.enriched` staging file. Three gates run before promoting to `CONTEXT.md`:
  1. **Decision-ID preservation**: every `D-XX` in original must exist in staging (missing → abort, no overwrite)
  2. **Body-preservation**: each decision body must be ≥ 80% similar to original (rewritten prose → abort)
  3. **Sub-section coverage**: warns if `**Endpoints:**` count ≠ decision count (non-fatal)
- Only if all 3 gates pass → staging promoted to `CONTEXT.md` atomically. On failure, staging preserved for user review; original CONTEXT.md untouched.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Session lifecycle helper** (`_shared/session-lifecycle.md`) wired into `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:build` — emits session-start banner + EXIT trap for clean tail UI across runs
- Stale state auto-sweep (configurable `session.stale_hours`, default 1h) — removes leftover `.review-state.json` / `.test-state.json` from previous interrupted runs
- Cross-platform port sweep (Windows netstat/taskkill + Linux lsof/kill) — kills orphan dev servers before new run
- Config: `session.stale_hours`, `session.port_sweep_on_start`

### Fixed
- Stuck "Phase 2b-1 / Phase 2b-2" items in Claude Code tail UI after interrupted `/vg:review` runs — EXIT trap now emits `━━━ EXITED at step=X ━━━` terminal marker

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Phase pipeline accuracy:** commands/docs consistently reference the correct 7-step pipeline `specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept` (was showing 6 steps, missing `specs` at front)
- `next.md` PIPELINE_STEPS order now includes `specs` — `/vg:next` can advance from specs-only state to scope
- `scripts/phase-recon.py` PIPELINE_STEPS now includes `specs` — phase reconnaissance detects specs-only phase correctly
- `phase.md` description, args, and inline docs reflect 7 steps
- `amend.md`, `blueprint.md`, `build.md`, `review.md`, `test.md` header pipelines include `specs` prefix
- `init.md` help text reflects 7-step phase pipeline

### Added
- `README.vi.md` — Vietnamese translation of README with cross-link back to English
- `README.md` — rewritten with clear 2-tier pipeline explanation (project setup + per-phase execution)
- Both READMEs now show the project-level setup chain (`/vg:init → /vg:project → /vg:roadmap → /vg:map → /vg:prioritize`) before the per-phase pipeline

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- `/vg:update` command — pull latest release from GitHub, 3-way merge with local edits, park conflicts in `.claude/vgflow-patches/`
- `/vg:reapply-patches` command — interactive per-conflict resolution (edit / keep-upstream / restore-local / skip)
- `scripts/vg_update.py` — Python helper implementing SemVer compare, SHA256 verify, 3-way merge via `git merge-file`, patches manifest persistence, GitHub release API query
- `/vg:progress` version banner — shows installed VG version + daily update check (lazy-cached)
- `migrations/template.md` — template for breaking-change migration guides
- Release tarball auto-build: GitHub Action builds + attaches `vgflow-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` + `.sha256` per tag

### Fixed
- Windows Python text mode CRLF translation in 3-way merge tmp file (caused false conflicts against LF-terminated ancestor files)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Initial public release of VGFlow
- 6-step pipeline: scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept
- Config-driven engine via `vg.config.md` — zero hardcoded stack values
- `install.sh` for fresh project install
- `sync.sh` for dev-side source↔mirror sync
- Claude Code commands (`commands/vg/`) + shared helpers
- Codex CLI skills parity (`codex-skills/vg-review`, `vg-test`)
- Gemini CLI skills parity (`gemini-skills/`)
- Python scripts for graphify, caller graph, visual diff, phase recon
- Commit-msg hook template enforcing citation + SemVer task IDs
- Infrastructure: override debt register, i18n narration, telemetry, security register, visual regression, incremental graphify
